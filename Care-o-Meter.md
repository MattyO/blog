# Care-o-Meter



Creating better feedback conversations.  

Have you ever written a Github comment, had hours of conversation about that comment, and in the end discovered that neither of you really cared about one solution or the other? It was on off-hand thought from the commenter and/or the author not no strong feelings.  This might happen because you are talking about trade-offs and there aren't great arguments for either side or it is incremental improvement(e.g a name change)

### The solution !

Enter the Care-o-MeterTM.  For the past few years I have been adding a small fraction to the end of every comment I add to feedback.  This number indicates how much I care about the attached feedback. 

> I think you should change the name of X to Y for reason Z. 1/10

> The approach of class X doesn't account for situation Y.  3/10

> The approach has a security risk in [this specific situation].  This could result in a unintended release of personal information of the user.  8/10

 The higher the number, the more I care.  These numbers are generally grouped into a few broad categories: 

* 1-2; is any off hand comment, you can ignore it if you like;
*  3-4. I care a bit, we should have a discussion that will take more than 5 minutes about this. ; 
* 5-7 I care alot about this, It is likely about a broad approach.  ; 
* 8+ Very strong opinions.  Likely about the correctness of the solution.    

This small change lets us focus on the things that we think are most important.  It helps us discover together where there are big difference in opinions.  It also helps keep me personally accountable when giving feedback.  Having lots of opinions is a feedback smell.  I'm I being over bearing and being a jerk? 

And that is it.  Just put a X/10 and the end of your comments and stop talking about things you don't care about sooner. :) 

Cheers, 

Matty
